# Simple-Notepad V 1.2.0

I am making a simple notepad application.

I have some problems and i don't know how to solve them.

Here is my issues:

1- Date/Time section works. But adding a Date/Time to a text deletes everything you wrote.

2- I want to add Colors section that gives to user a permission to change text color. But i cant do it. > <

3- When I open a .txt file. with my Simple Notepad app. no text shows up...  I have to manually open a .txt file by the Open... section.


These are my problems right now. I would be grateful if someone can help me with these

Thank You. ^^
